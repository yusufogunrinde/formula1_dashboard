# Formula1 Racing Dashboard
The datasets were sourced from Kaggle, and it’s on the Formula1 Grand prix racing events, covering from 1950 to 2022. Dataset consist of drivers, race and fastest lap details. 
Approaching the task, I assumed the position of a service agency which was consulted the Kalaphina Mogul Group, who are interested in investing in Formula1 car partnership deals, close endorsement with drivers and also serve as mind, fitness and health agent. Their goal was identifying the potential and top drivers, cars raking with consistency, race event patterns, when the season hit top activities and its lows to help drivers structure proper fitness and vacation schedule. Identify countries that have demonstrated great potentials for racing (just like Brazilians in the world of football).
Straight at it. Their goals were clear, they wouldn’t afford a chance to start out bad, and also to harness potential deals just anywhere it exists.
